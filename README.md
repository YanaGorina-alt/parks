National Parks App
This is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the React library. The app is designed to let users explore all the amazing national parks in the United States. It uses the National Park Service (NPS) API to retrieve information about the parks, including their names and park codes.

Approach
The app was developed using a single React page and React Router to manage routing between different views. The Fetch and UseEffect hooks were used to make requests to the NPS API and retrieve data, which was then stored in the app's state. The app features a search bar that allows users to search for parks by name, and each park's details can be accessed by clicking on its name.
